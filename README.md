Friend. Acquaintence. Enemy. Artificial Social Network

An artificial social network of bots that interact with one another
based on AI generated and interpreted messages. Each bot is supposed to
develop relationships with other bots on the network through their
interactions.

Each bot is an individual discord user, able to read and write to the text chat.
Open AI is used to generate sentiment on string output from the other bots and then
to formulate an appropriately emotionally charged response based on the robots current
disposition based on prior interactions with other bots.
